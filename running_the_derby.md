# Before Race Day

## Checking in cars
Create a spreadsheet containgin two worksheets with the following columns

    Car Number | Scout Name | Car Name | Weight (oz) | Checked In

The first workshee should be labeled "Scout Division", and the second "Outlaw Division"

Ideally at a pack meeting or a dedicated check-in location before the race, populate the worksheets with the cars.

**IMPORTANT** - as you enter a row in the spreadhsheet, write the number on the bottom of the car!  

**ALSO IMPORTANT** - be sure to underline 6 and 9 appropriately to prevent confusion
